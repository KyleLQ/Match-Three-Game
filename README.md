# Match 3 Game

## Description of Project:

The project I will make is a match 3 game. It will let players swap around adjacent gems in order to get at least 
3 of the same type of gem in a row. If they do this successfully, then players will earn points. New gems will drop
down if the player successfully matches 3, and the goal of the game is to keep matching 3 gems until it is impossible
to do so.

**Hardcore gamers**, like *Candy Crush Saga* **gamers**, will be sure to find hours of entertainment from my game. 
This project is of interest to me because I like playing games.


## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to generate random boards to play on
- As a user, I want to be able to swap two adjacent gem's positions. If this causes a match of 3 or more, then
  the gems will disappear and gems from above will fall into the empty tiles. **New gems will also 
  be *added* to the board if this happens.**
- As a user, I want to be able to earn points from matching 3 or more gems, and to view my points earned.
- As a user, I want to be able to exchange points for special abilities, like clearing all gems in a row.
- As a user, while in the middle of playing, I want to be able to save my board and points.
- As a user, when starting the game, I want to be able to load my board and points from a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to add gems to make my own custom board

## Phase 4 Task 2:

(The user creates a random board, then makes some swaps, then clears a row)

## Phase 4 Task 3:
- Remove the association from GameFrame to JsonWriter, and make it a dependency instead, since JsonWriter is
only used in one method. (So make JsonWriter a local variable instead)
- Make an abstract superclass for my mouse listener classes, since they all share similar code to identify the 
row and col clicked, and then constrain that row and col. So I would move this similar code to the superclass.
- Although I did make my methods robust by just checking the input with if conditions, I should try to include my own
exception classes and throw those instead, as then I could handle exceptions using try catch finally, which seem more
powerful than just using if conditions.
- There is some duplication in the Board class, which I could refactor out into one method. For example, the
makeGemsFallDown and swapGems method both swap gems and share similar code at some places, so I could refactor that 
similar code out.
- the player removeRow method seems like it should belong in Board instead, since its main function is to modify the
grid of a given board.
- I may want to try to reduce the multiplicity of the association from GameFrame to Board to just 1. The second board
is only used for the swapping gem function/button handler, and is not really needed elsewhere. I could make the second 
board a local variable instead of a field.
- I may be able to use the observer pattern, where the Board is the observer and the various listeners and handlers
are the observables/subjects. This may be able to reduce the number of classes that have associations to Board, as they
will simply have a list of Observers instead. However, one difficulty with this is that Board does different things
depending on the buttons. So this could end up with one update method being responsible for a ridiculous number of
things.
